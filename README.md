Welcome to the Introduction to Collaborative Development course! This repository contains all necessary resources to achieve a basic formation in common development practices, Python programming and code editing skills.

It is intended to be a foundation for collaborative development. It can be really useful for students that are starting their career in the industry. It does not intend to replace any official courses, yet it covers a set of topics that can be used as a kickstart for further learning.

### Environment setup

This section covers the steps required to set up the collaborative environment for software development. It is divided into three subsections:

1. **Version control**: introduction to Git usage through the GitHub platform, as well as GitHub-specific tools for team collaboration.
   1. Git setup
   2. Git and GitHub features
   3. GitHub Desktop setup

2. **Python**: introduction to the language and component setup.
   1. Interpreter setup
   2. Package manager setup
   3. Virtual environment setup (future updates)

3. **Visual Studio Code**: introduction to the editor tool and component setup.
   1. Editor setup
   2. Extensions setup

### Python programming

This section covers topics related to Python programming from basic to intermediate level. It is divided into three subsections:

1. Standard **data types**, **control statements**, **functions** and **classes**
2. **Error handling** and **external libraries usage**
3. **Code stylization**

## How to follow the course?

The course is designed to cover several topics in a organized way. In order to do that, you only need to read a chapter until you reach the end, where you will find a link to the next one.

You are free to explore the repository as you wish, yet it is highly recommended to follow the course in the expected order, since not doing so might lead to confusion, configuration errors and other undetermined issues.

## Git

First off, let's start by installing Git as our version control software. You will find all the necessary instructions in [the next chapter](/docs/version-control/git/README.md).
